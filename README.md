#  USF Bus Transportation SQL Project â€“ Project 2.2

This project was completed for the **Principles of Data Engineering** course at the University of South Florida. It involves designing, building, and analyzing a realistic transportation database system using advanced SQL techniques.

---

##  Project Overview

The goal of this project was to simulate a real-world data engineering task by:

1. Creating a normalized relational database schema
2. Inserting realistic transportation data across multiple entities
3. Writing and analyzing 20 advanced SQL queries
4. Implementing database enhancements using triggers, views, and constraints

- **File:** `Project2_Team10.sql`
- Description: Creates 42 relational tables covering customers, trips, tickets, employees, buses, payments, luggage, reviews, and more.

### Part 2: Advanced SQL Queries + Final Report
- **File:** `Project2.2AllQueries.sql`
- Description: Contains 20 business-focused queries analyzing ticket sales, revenue, capacity, customer behavior, employee performance, and trip patterns.

- **File:** `Group 10 Project 2.2 - Documentos de Google.pdf`
- Description: PDF report with SQL outputs, data interpretation, and conclusions for all 20 queries.

###  Part 3: Triggers, Views, and Constraints
- **File:** `Project 2.3.sql`
- Description: Adds database integrity features including:
  - `AFTER` and `INSTEAD OF` triggers
  - Views for analysis and reporting
